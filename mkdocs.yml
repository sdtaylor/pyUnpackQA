# The product pages are auto-generated by copying the markdown descriptions
# in the yaml files of the product_files/ directory. This is done in
# the script render_product_markdown_files.py
#
# The api.md file is autogenerated by the mkdocstrings plugin for
# the mkdocs package
# The exclude plugin is used to exclude the docs/examples_dev/ folder,
# when mkdocs does build or deploy. This folder can have various scripts, 
# jupiter notebooks, and data files, and I only want to rendered notebook
# html files included in the docs. These are written to docs/examples/
