# pyUnpackQA  
Routines for unpacking all common remote sensing QA bands.  

- Works with single QA values, 1D arrays (eg. time series), or 2D arrays (full scenes).  
- The same methods are used for all sensors, with specific product flags specified via arguments.  
- No file reading or writing.  
- numpy is the only dependecy.
