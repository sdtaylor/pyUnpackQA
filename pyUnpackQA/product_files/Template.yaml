  # The descrption should have the full product and QA band name. Descriptions
  # of all flags, ideally in a markdown table. The reference documentation where
  # Some data products have multiple QA bands, each with different flags, and
  # those should be unique entries.  
  # The pipe (|) symbole here indicates the "literal block style" so that all newlines
  # in the "description" entry will be preserved. 
  # This entry will end up in the documentation.

    For band saturation:
        0 = no saturation
        1 = saturated data
        
    For terrain occlusion:
        0 = no terrain occlusion
        1 = terrain occlusion
